      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <h2>1. You take a photo of the object</h2>
      <br>
      <h2><s>2. The app sends the image to one of our engineers who Google's the answer</s></h2>
      <br>
      <h2>2.  The app uses machine learning data to classify your object</h2>

      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h2>1. I think the app classified an object incorrectly and it deeply hurt my feelings</h2>
      <h2 style = "color:red">Ans. Shoot me an email with what the product was and what was it classified as.</h2>
      <br>
      <h2>2. The app classified me as trash.</h2>
      <h2 style = "color:red">Ans. Maybe the app isn't wrong?</h2>
      <br>
      <h2>3. How can I improve the accuracy?</h2>
      <h2 style = "color:red">Ans. Take photos of objects one at a time with good lighting and take photos from an angle in which the object is in it's most identifiable form</h2>
